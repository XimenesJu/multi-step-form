# multi-step-form   
   This project is a challenge from the Front End Mentor website.  
   
I choose this especific project as a way of studying and learning more about JavaScript forms of interactions that can be applied to a form as well as understanding more about inputs stylization, hover and active atributes, background image manipulation, font size manipulation and HTML tag semantics.
